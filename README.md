# University Utilities

An eclectic mix of things I find useful for university work.

## Latex Utilities

This has a class for writing TMAs, and a style for creating electron
spin diagrams. Also, there's an example of how to coax `biber` into
producing Harvard Cite-Them-Right references.

In addition, there are a couple of `bbx` files for Harvard CTR
references but I don't know how accurate they are.

## Typst Utilities

A package for writing TMAs which attempts to replicate the
Latex class above using Typst.

## Obsidian Snippets for the Latex-Suite Plug-in

Put these into a directory in the root of your vault,
and then update the plug-in configuration to use this
directory.

## Devcontainers

Here are two devcontainers; one contains an
environment for Typst, the other for Latex work.
Both have Python and some data analysis packages
using `Jupyter` within `vscode`.
