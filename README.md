# University Utilities

An eclectic mix of things I find useful for university work.

## Latex Utilities

This has a class for writing TMAs, and a style for creating electron
spin diagrams. Also, there's an example of how to coax `biber` into
producing Harvard Cite-Them-Right references.

In addition, there are a couple of `bbx` files for Harvard CTR
references but I don't know how accurate they are.

## Obsidian Snippets for the Latex-Suite Plug-in

Put these into a directory in the root of your vault, 
and then update the plug-in configuration to use this
directory.


## Devcontainers

Here is a devcontainer for `vscode`, producing an
environment for Latex work, Python and some data analysis
using `Jupyter` within `vscode`.
